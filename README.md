This repository contains clean and structured implementations of key Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. These implementations were developed with the aim of building a solid understanding of the underlying concepts and methods.

Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
- Naive Bayes Classifier
Sequence Modeling
- Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Deep Learning
- Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Dependencies
-Python 3.7+
-NumPy
-Pandas
-scikit-learn
-matplotlib / seaborn
-TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN and FNN)
-hmmlearn (for HMM)

Learning Objectives
-Understand core ML and DL concepts through practical implementation
-Explore algorithm behavior on synthetic and standard datasets
-Visualize outputs and evaluate model performance
-Build models from scratch and with libraries for comparison
